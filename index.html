    <h1>My Pet Raccoon.</h1>
    <p>Most people keep cats or dogs as pets, but for me, no animal can match up the love I have for raccoons!</p>
    <p><strong>Why racoons, you ask</strong>? Well, no other animal really embraces it's nature like the racoon does. Most people hate racoons, calling them "Trash Pandas" and "Convicts in the animal kingdom" (due to the darkened patches around the eyes and their black and white stripped fur, which makes them look like they have prisoners' uniform, while also looking like masked robbers.) But really, raccoons donn't deserve the dirt on their name. Most of these observations are made on raccoons that live in the wild. With proper care and attention to these wonderful creatures, one comes to realize that raccons can actually be one of the best animals to be kept as pets!</p>
    
    <h2>Rick</h2>
    <p>My pet's name is Rick. Rick really loves playing with rubber ducks, one reason being they are chewy and almost indestructible (to him, of course) and also because it produces a squeak when pressed.Rick also loves running around, watching TV (awesome, right?), and of course, digging through the trash whenever the chance presents itself. But generally, Rick is the coolest and most chilled pet I ever had!</p>

    <h2>Here are some interesting facts about raccoons:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg.</li>
      <li>Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather.</li>
      <li>Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail.</li>
      <li>Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.</li>
      <li>They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.</li>
      <li>Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behavior. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four raccoons to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders.</li>
      <li>The raccoon, whose method of locomotion is usually considered to be plantigrade, can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws.</li>
    </ul>
