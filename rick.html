    <h1>My Pet Racoon.</h1>
    <p>Most people keep cats or dogs as pets, but for me, no animal can match up the love I have for racoons!</p>
    <p>Why racoons, you ask? Well, no other animal really embraces it's nature like the racoon does. Most people hate racoons, calling them "Trash Pandas" and "Convicts in the animal kingdom" (due to the darkened patches around the eyes and their black and white stripped fur, which makes them look like they have prisoners' uniform, while also looking like masked robbers.)</p>
    <h2>Rick</h2>
    <p>My pet's name is Rick. Rick really loves playing with rubber ducks, one reason being they are chewy and almost indestructible (to him, of course) and also because it produces a squeak when pressed.Rick also loves running around, watching TV (awesome, right?), and of course, digging through the trash whenever the chance presents itself. But generally, Rick is the coolest and most chilled pet I ever had! </p>
